8cam is a Windows Phone app I made that lets you take pictures that have large pixels
giving them a retro look. The nice thing about this app is that it doesn't work with
filters after taking the picture. In 8cam you can see the pixelated image live, while
you are pointing your phone at what you want to capture.

8cam currently has all 4 or 5 star reviews (mostly 5 stars).
