take a look at [my LinkedIn profile](https://be.linkedin.com/in/petermorlion) or [GitHub account](https://github.com/petermorlion).

## Assists

A Wordpress site for emotional development in organisations, of which I made the theme, based off an existing theme.

## Arcelor-Mittal Ghent

My first project here was to rewrite the automation of two blast furnaces in .NET (with a WPF client). 
Previously, it was written in Fortran. I led a team of 3 (myself included) and we successfully put the 
application in production, without major glitches.

I also helped out with a stock-keeping project.

## Voedselkalender

A simple Windows Phone app to easily see what fruits and vegetables are seasonal in which month.

## 8cam

A Windows Phone camera app to take "pixelated" images, like in retro 8bit graphics. It doesn't use
filters after taking your picture (although this is possible). It shows the pixelated picture through
the viewfinder, while you are pointing your phone at what you want to take a photo of.

## Logopedie-Verscheure.be

A simple, informative website for a speech therapist/remedial teacher, with attention to SEO.
