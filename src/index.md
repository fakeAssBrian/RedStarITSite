Red Star IT is the software consultancy company under whose name I, [Peter Morlion](http://www.petermorlion.com), can be hired. I also have published a few apps under that name.

Why would you hire me? I've been programming since 2005 and have a strong focus on code quality and user-friendliness. I also look for the right tool for the right job, instead of shoe-horning everything in a familiar stack.
