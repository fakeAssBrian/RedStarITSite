In short, I'm a programmer for hire. I specialize, but don't limit myself, to .NET
(both client and server, desktop and web) and modern web technologies ([HTML](http://www.petermorlion.com/tag/html/),
[javascript](http://www.petermorlion.com/tag/javascript/) and css).

More important than specific technologies (at least it should be), is my approach to
and philosophy on programming.

I firmly believe in [the Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/), [TDD](http://www.petermorlion.com/when_do_you_write_your_tests_/) and writing automated
tests (and automating tedious tasks in general), [clean, clear and separated code](http://www.petermorlion.com/an_overview_of_things_i_find_important/),
and providing the end user with a good experience.

This last point is what makes software development rewarding. Having a user that uses
your product and actually likes it.

You can also have a look at [my LinkedIn profile](https://be.linkedin.com/in/petermorlion)
 for more detailed information on my experience.
