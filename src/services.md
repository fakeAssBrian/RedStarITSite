In short, I'm a programmer for hire. I specialize, but don't limit myself, to .NET
(both client and server, desktop and web) and modern web technologies (HTML, javascript
  and css).

More important than specific technologies (at least it should be), is my approach to
and philosophy on programming.

I firmly believe in [the Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/), [TDD](http://www.petermorlion.com/when_do_you_write_your_tests_/) and writing automated
tests (and automating tedious tasks in general), clean, clear and separated code,
and providing the end user with a good experience.

This last point is what makes software development rewarding. Having a user that uses
your product and actually likes it.
